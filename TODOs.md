# GIPH-IE

## Description
A web application that searches a movie for its summary/synopis/plot, and returns a matching (or related) gif image. 

## User Story


As a movie-goer / movie-fan,

I want to find the summary of a movie and matching gif images

So that I can quickly learn about the movie and have an image of it in mind

## APIs to be Used
- GIPHY API
- OMDB API 

## Tasks / TODOS
- Create HTML
- Create CSS with a (not Boostrap) Framework
- Read the documentation for the APIs and the nonCSS Framework
- Create a Javascript file to make it all happen
- Choose a CSS Framework

## Project Requirements
- Must use at least two server-side APIs
- Must use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap
- Must use client-side storage to sort persistent data
- Must have a polished UI
- Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming, etc)
- Must NOT use alerts, confirms, or prompts (look into modals)
- Must be deployed to GitHub Pages
- Must be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input)

## Useful Notes: 

To pull a request with giphy: 

https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint/#search 


## Additional Ideas: 
- Feeling Lucky? (A random search for a movie and giphy)
- A random movie quote that is called with every refresh of the page
- Adding a giphy image with actor/actresses in it (use ex. data.actors from the ODMB and set that as search parameter for Giphy)
