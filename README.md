## Purpose 

Movie-Giphy is a web application that takes in a movie name as the user input and displays the movie's summary and related gifs. The gifs are categorized by movie name related gifs, and actors names related gifs. The user is initially prompted to enter a valid movie; the application will then use that movie's name to request and fetch information from two diffferent APIs (Open Movie Database, Giphy). The summary is retreived from the OMD and both gifs categories are retreived from Gify
